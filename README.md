# CarDekhoRegression
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based tool to predict the prices of used cars for CarDekho. The goal is to enhance customer experience and streamline pricing with an interactive web application built using Streamlit.

Key Steps:
Problem Statement:
Create an accurate and user-friendly tool to predict used car prices based on various features like model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

Data Processing:

Consolidate data from multiple cities into a structured format.
Handle missing values, standardize data formats, and encode categorical features.
Normalize numerical features and manage outliers for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Perform descriptive statistics and visualize data to identify patterns.
Use feature selection techniques to determine the most influential factors affecting car prices.
Model Development:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Train models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Select the best-performing model for deployment.
Deployment:

Deploy the final model using Streamlit.
Create an intuitive web interface where users can input car details and get real-time price predictions.
Outcome:
An interactive tool for predicting used car prices, helping CarDekho improve customer satisfaction and optimize the pricing process.
